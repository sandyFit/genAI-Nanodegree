# HomeMatch Real Estate Listings App

## Overview

HomeMatch is an AI-powered real estate platform that provides personalized property recommendations by leveraging advanced natural language processing and vector search capabilities. The system intelligently matches user preferences with property listings using semantic search and generates customized property descriptions.

This IPython Notebook provides a streamlined, end-to-end pipeline for generating, processing, and presenting personalized real estate listings using cutting-edge tools like LangChain and OpenAI. It covers data generation, embedding listings into a vector database, enabling efficient semantic search, and delivering personalized recommendations via an interactive widget.

## Key Features

### 🏠 Intelligent Property Generation

* Automatically creates realistic and diverse real estate listings using OpenAI's language models.
* Generates comprehensive property details including neighborhood descriptions, pricing, specifications, and detailed descriptions.
* Produces varied property types to simulate a realistic real estate market.

### 🔍 Semantic Search & Matching

* Converts property listings into high-dimensional vector embeddings using OpenAI's embedding models.
* Stores embeddings in ChromaDB vector database for fast, semantic-based property retrieval.
* Enables natural language queries that understand user intent beyond exact keyword matching.

### 🎯 Personalized Recommendations

* Processes user preferences written in natural language.
* Transforms casual requests into structured, searchable queries.
* Generates personalized property descriptions that highlight features most relevant to user preferences.
* Handles budget constraints intelligently, acknowledging limitations while presenting alternatives.

### 🛠 Modular Architecture

* Core functionality encapsulated in a reusable `services.py` module.
* Clean separation of concerns for maintainability and extensibility.
* Easy integration with web interfaces or other applications.

### Interactive Widget
The widget provides a **complete testing and demonstration environment** for validating search quality, personalization effectiveness, and showcasing the platform's AI capabilities to stakeholders.

## Technical Architecture

```
User Input → Preference Processing → Vector Search → Result Personalization → Output
     ↓              ↓                    ↓                ↓
Natural Language → Structured Query → ChromaDB → Customized Descriptions
```

**Components:**

* **OpenAI API:** Powers listing generation, preference processing, and description personalization.
* **ChromaDB:** Vector database for embedding storage and semantic search.
* **LangChain:** Framework for chaining AI operations and managing embeddings.
* **Python Services:** Core business logic and data management.
