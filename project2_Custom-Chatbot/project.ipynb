    "## üóΩ Compost in the City üå±\n",
    "\n",
    "Composting turns organic waste into nutrient-rich fertilizer, improving soil health, reducing landfill methane, conserving water, and cutting household food waste. Yet in New York City, where most residents live in small apartments without outdoor space, home composting is often impractical. \n",
    "\n",
    "**CompostPal** solves this challenge. Powered by a 2025 dataset (`Food_Scrap_Drop-Off_Locations_in_NYC2025.csv`) from NYC‚Äôs open data portal, it delivers up-to-date details on compost drop-off sites across all five boroughs‚Äîaddresses, hours, and restrictions‚Äîso residents can easily find nearby locations. This makes zero-waste living more accessible in one of the world‚Äôs most densely populated cities.\n",

    "---\n",

    "### Dataset Choice & Rationale\n",
    "\n",
    "I chose the **Food Scrap Drop-Off Locations in NYC 2025** dataset because it provides up-to-date, hyperlocal information‚Äîsite names, addresses, hours, and restrictions, essential for practical composting guidance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pre-trained models can offer general composting advice but lack this current, borough-specific data. Integrating it allows the chatbot to give actionable answers like ‚ÄúDrop off at XYZ Park, Saturday 10 AM‚Äì12 PM. No meat or dairy accepted,‚Äù turning abstract advice into concrete action.\n",
    "\n",
    "This addresses a real urban challenge: most NYC residents can‚Äôt compost at home and face fragmented, outdated information online. With semantic search, the chatbot can match queries by location, time, or materials, delivering relevant results instantly.\n",
    "\n",
    "By embedding this dataset, the project demonstrates how domain-specific knowledge transforms a generic AI into a specialized, impactful tool that supports a healthier, more sustainable city, one banana peel at a time."

    "\n",
    "## Key Features:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Dataset & Data Processing**: Uses cleaned 2025 NYC compost data, reducing 591 to 201 locations, sampled 20 sites, with standardized notes via summarize\\_note().\n",
    "- **Embeddings Generation**: Uses OpenAI's text-embedding-ada-002 model to create semantic vectors\n",
    "- **Semantic Search**: Implements cosine similarity-based relevance ranking via get_rows_sorted_by_relevance()\n",
    "- **Smart Prompt Engineering**: Token-aware prompt composition with create_prompt() function\n",
    "- **Context Management**: Balances relevant information inclusion with API token limits\n",
    "- **Performance Comparison**: Compares baseline vs. custom chatbot, showing localized data enables actionable, location-specific answers absent in generic AI responses.\n",
    "- **Live Chatbot Interface**: Interactive chatbot with continuous dialogue, commands, UX enhancements, and robust error handling for API failures and edge cases."

Additionally, the NYC Department of Sanitation has a list of drop-off locations where residents can drop off their compost for processing.
